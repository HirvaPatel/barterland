## Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Javascript Library (Front End)
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - Deployment
* [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JavaScript Runtime Environment (Back End)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Database
* [ExpressJs](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Web Application Framework for NodeJS

## Code Integration and Working flow of each task in the feature.

##### Login page: 
Once the user logins into the application, the backend api retuns the userid, username, email and role along with the success response. These values are set inside a Reactsession variable with a set method which will be used by other features in the application using the reactsession get method. While developing other features, it is important to know which user is currently using the application. 
##### Register page: 
Once the user is registered into application, they are redirected to the login page of the application.
##### EmailValidation: 
Once the user clicks on the forgot password, the user will be asked to provide the email id they used during the time of registration, which will be evaluated and the message user verifired will be shown to the user and they will be redirected to the Forgot password page of the application.
##### ForgotPassword:
Once the user is verified, they will be shown with the security question they choose during the time of registration. The user will be asked to provide the security answer and the new password. The security password will be evaluated against the value present in the database and the user will be not be able to give the old password as the new password. Once the password is updated, the user will be redirected to the login page of the application.
##### UserUpdate:
Once the user clicks on the profile they will be able to see their details and are provided with an option to update the information such as name, email id, password and address. In addition, the user is also provided with an option to delete the user account. If the the user clicks on delete user account, the user account will be deleted and they will be redirected to the home page of the application.
##### Logout:
Once the user clicks on the logout, all the session values will be cleared and the user will be redirected to the homepage of the application.
##### Search:
Once the user search for an item, all the related Ads  will be displayed to the user.

##### MyAdvertisement and Feedback
The component is integrated with the template and the home page. From the main menu of the home page MyAds page is redirected. The webpage is developed using the template for the header manu page and the footer component. The user session management is integrated with the local storage where the user database is stored. If and viewer of the website opens the MyAds page without logging in, the user will be asked to login first and they will have an option to redirect to the login or the home page.

##### HomePage
The following components are developed to be reused in all the pages, these can be reused as follows :
```
            <TitleSection />
            <MenuSection />
             .... // Add your main page components here
            <FooterSection />
```
The title section component will return a component which will render the title section of the application with various links. It uses the user data to do conditional rendering, i.e., whether to show Login and Register or to show User Profile Link and Logout links.
The Menu section component will return a component which will render the menu section which will have various links suchs as, My Deals, My Ads, etc..
The Footer Section component will return a component which will render the footer section which will have various links such as About Us, Contact Us, etc..

```
<MainSectionGenerator ads={ads} userData={data} />
```
Pass the list of Ads as input to the above mentioned component, and it will render multiple rows with each row containing three Ads. Use this when developing features such as Search, to pass the list of Ads. Refer the API References section to find the structure of the list to pass.

##### Wishlist
To integrate this feature: First we have to add the add to wishlist button into all products of the home page. Then we have to set route for the wishlist button to view the wishlisted products. Then we have to do the session management in the wishlist page so we can know which user is logged in the wishlist page. At last, we need the same database setup so we can update the data of each user in whole application.
